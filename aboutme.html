									<p>A more personal experience.

								</header>
								<p>Welcome, I'm Blake.
									<br> I've been enthralled by data's pivotal role in tackling complex business questions to enable us to be more informed and deliver data-driven solutions. At a young age I was told I excelled in learning, as a result I attempted to make the most of it. Although school offered these opportunities, I fell into self studying what I enjoyed and realised years later it was valuable. Towards the end of school I was diagnosed with ASD(Aspergers) and ADHD, which gave me a deeper understanding of myself, my strengths and weaknesses. From here I was a chemical compounder for a pharmacy in Sydney prior to moving to the Gold Coast. This first job identified my core strengths in potential job fields, being problem solving and critical thinking.
				
								</p>
								<p>Pharmacy opened the door to discovering data analytics, as I found myself unknowingly practicing these skills for personal use. I started with just over a year of self study while working, then saught to gain qualifications and build connections within the industry. Following this I started my first position as a data analyst, specialising in cleaning and transformation of large datasets using RStudio proceeding to visualisation with Tableau. This position cemented my passion for the field and upon the end of my contract I began to further refine my skills and connections. Analysing the most effective ways to both gain a progressively deeper understanding of skills required to succeed in the field and convey to employers that I can deliver the analysis accurately and able to be understood by all involved.<br><br>
								This ultimately led to refinement of my resume and learning some HTML and CSS to deliver my portfolio on a platform I'm proud to display. <br><br>
							I appreciate time taken to read the more personal side to me and I'm looking foward to working with you.<br>
						Blake.</p>
